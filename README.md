# Summary
The project was made as an engineering diploma thesis at the Cracow University of Technology. The project involved the creation of a device that switches the power supply of a mobile device. For this purpose was used EPS8266 microcontroller that operates the website and web server.

I decided to rebuild my project and lern new frontend technologies. In the new version, the appearance of the website has been slightly changed and amphasis has been placed on the responsivness of the web application. Next, there is a chapter in which I list the technologies used in this project.
