# Summary
The project was made as an engineering diploma thesis at the Cracow University of Technology. The project involved the creation of a device that switches the power supply of a mobile device. For this purpose was used EPS8266 microcontroller that operates the website and web server.

I decided to rebuild my project and lern new frontend technologies. In the new version, the appearance of the website has been slightly changed and amphasis has been placed on the responsivness of the web application. Next, there is a chapter in which I list the technologies used in this project.

>I am a master's student of AWSB in Dąbrowa Górnicza, majoring in computer science, specializing in artificial intelligence management. I am a graduate of the Krakow University of Technology, majoring in electrical engineering. I belonged to research groups dealing with microprocessor programming and 3D graphics. Thanks to my professional experience, I have gained the ability to work in a team and organize this work into individual tasks.

# Functionalities

## Main page

The main page display qoutes. I implemented a function that randomly selects one of the quotes save in the json file. 

There is no slide-out menu in the desctop version, but in the mobile version I removed the date and time display, as you can see in the photos below.

   <img src="/README_files/desctop-main.png" alt="Login form" width="1213" height="600">
 </p>

## Power & cooling

Power page and cooling page function similarly. The user can choose the socket into which he plugs the electrical device, and uses the buttons to set whether it should be turned on or off. In the original version, I added additional options such as min and max battery level and a sleep timer. In the future, I will also add UI to the functions I have already written in previous version.
